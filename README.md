# knowledge-graph-analysis-tool

Web application for GraphDB database query and analysis

This user interface serves as an illustration of some of the research tasks that have been performed during the internship and constitute a proof of concept for an end-to-end data analysis method. The goal is for the user to automatically generate SQL views of the data contained in GraphDB's knowledge graph database without writing sparql queries. These views would later be used to create Power Bi vizuals for data analysis and presentation. 

It currently utilizes a template model for query generation, but later, with a natural Language to SPARQL query conversion system, the platform is aimed to offer an easy to use analysis tool for the team of the Temporal Knowledge Base Group at Jaume University.

It also allows users to generate Pyvis graphs and computer different node centrality metrics and rankings in order to compare Cities by attractiveness or twitter accounts by reputation.
